    <p>A wiki (wik-ee) is a website that provides collaborative modification of its content and structure 
    directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language 
    (known as "wiki markup") and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor. A wiki is run using 
    wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, 
    both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open 
    source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); 
    for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access 
    without enforcing access control. Other rules may also be imposed to organize content. A wiki engine is 
    a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, 
    in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, 
    allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site, 
      using only a standard "plain-vanilla" Web browser without any extra add-ons.</li>
      <li>Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy 
      and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.</li>
      <li>A wiki is not a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers, and designed for casual visitors. 
      Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that 
      constantly changes the website landscape.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require 
    to contribute is a computer, Internet access, a web browser and a basic understanding of a simple markup language 
    (e.g., HTML). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, 
    which are usually well-interconnected by hyperlinks, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, 
    browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, while 
    also allowing for editor argument, debate and interaction regarding the content and formatting. A defining 
    characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no 
    review by a moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many 
    wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts. Many edits can 
    be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online. However, this feature facilitates abuse of the system. 
    Private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. Maged N. Kamel Boulos, 
    Cito Maramba and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social Darwinism. " 'Unfit' sentences and 
    sections are ruthlessly culled, edited and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the 
    evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue 
    information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page.
